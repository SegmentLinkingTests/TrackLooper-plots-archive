# TrackLoooper plots archive

This repository is used as an archive for plots made by the CI workflow for each pull request of the TrackLooper repository. It aims to permanently store validation and comparison plots, so that it is easier to keep track of progress and look back in cases when it is found that a PR introduced an issue.

The contents of this repository should not be modified manually, as the entire process is designed to be fully automated.
